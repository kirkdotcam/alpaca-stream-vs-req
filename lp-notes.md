# REST API vs Streaming: Next steps in data

## Big Data

- We currently live in an era of big data, but what does big data mean?
  - Data Volume: How much data there is in terms of storage. This problem has been largely solved with modern databases and compression. Think: amazon redshift, snowflake, mongodb
  - Data Velocity: How quickly is data being generated, captured, and analyzed? This problem is under constant evolution because of the wide variety of tools and techniques available for highly variable situations. Our lecture today focuses mostly on this topic
  - Data Variety: What types of information can we store? This problem is largely stored with the contemporary variety of NoSQL databases, including MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j. 
  - Data Varacity: How accurate is your data? This is another area of constant evolution because _most_ data is unstructured, out-of-date, and/or conflicting. Think: what comes up when you google your name? is it accurate and specific to _you_? 

- Although we have solutions for some of these data issues, we are still actively investigating ways to improve techniques for all of them.

- Today we're going to focus on the data velocity problem by covering how web applications handle data through network requests.
